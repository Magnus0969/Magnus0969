- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "bug" in coding comes from a real, life-sized bug! In 1947, a moth got stuck in a computer at Harvard University and caused a malfunction.
                Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer science, found the moth and jokingly referred to it as a "bug" in the machine.
                The term stuck, and today we still call errors in code "bugs" and the process of fixing them "debugging."
